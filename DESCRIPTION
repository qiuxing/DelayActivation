Description: This package provides a set of tools to determine whether a gene has delayed activation or not, and when the activation starts, etc.  These criteria can serve as an alternative to model based cluster analysis such as those provided by \pkg{circlust}.  Four criteria are implemented in this package: 1. regular/delay genes; 2. number of modes (local min/max); 3. activation time; 4. up/down regulation.  So far I think it is only good for internal use.  A report \file{delay\_activation2.pdf} is distributed with this package.
